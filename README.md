# tor-data-classification
Classification of tor data using deep learning techniques.


## General idea

1. Clean tor/non-tor data
2. Read research papers using transformers for classifying network traffic
3. Implement NN based classifiers


## Running

Run the ipynb file in any python notebook environment with python3.7+
The dataset could used can be found at <a href='https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/tor.html'>UNB-CIC Tor-NonTor</a>
Used tensorflow for NN implementation and scikitlearn for logistical regression
