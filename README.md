# tor-data-classification
Classification of tor data using deep learning techniques.


## General idea

1. Clean tor/non-tor data
2. Use existing techniques like LSTM-RNN and CNN to classify data
3. Read research papers using transformers for classifying network traffic
4. Use transformers to classify tor traffic
